                        <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
                        <p>Our goal is to improve transparency and accessibility in 3D building modeling, particularly in regions where high-quality height data are not yet publicly available. We are seeking to obtain building
                            height data products to develop and release an open benchmark dataset for the research community. This dataset will support the training and evaluation of deep learning models for 3D building
                            reconstruction and height estimation, with a particular focus on developing regions in Asia, South America, and Africa. The dataset will be made publicly available for research and educational purposes
                            only, with full transparency regarding data provenance and usage conditions. All contributing data sources will be properly acknowledged, and any license terms will be strictly respected. </p>
